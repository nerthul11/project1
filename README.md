# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

While the website's text is in Spanish due to it being a learning project and Spanish being my native language,
all the coding and comments have been stated in English so it can be easily read by anyone who's willing to.

The database used is hosted on my local computer, so all sensitive data will not be shared.

In order for this to work properly, you should configure the database you will be using,
then running imports.py so all tables are properly created. Finally, run the server by
setting on the command line 'set FLASK_APP=application.py' and then 'flask run'.
